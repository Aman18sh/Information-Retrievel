The court gave Mehta, representing the Centre, time till 10.30 am on Friday to file his reply. In the last hearing, a bench led by Justice BR Gavai had sought SG’s assistance on whether theSIT constituted by the Andhra Pradesh governmentshould carry on the investigation or if the matter required a probe by a central agency. The court was hearing three petitions filed by senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha MP and former TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy, and the third one by historian Vikram Sampath and spiritual discourse speaker Dushyanth Sridhar. During the last hearing, the top court questioned Chandrababu Naidu over going public with allegations that animal fat-laced adulterated ghee was used to prepare the famous laddus at Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati without conclusive proof. ""So what was the need to go to the press at all, when you yourself ordered an investigation"", the top court asked, remarking ""At least, the Gods should be kept away from politics"". The top court had said that individuals holding constitutional office are expected to keep religion separate from politics, noting that Chief Minister Naidu spoke about the matter even before a case was filed ora Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted. The court said that Naidu made the claim on September 18, even though the FIR was lodged on September 25 and an SIT team was constituted on September 26. Chandrababu Naidu had earlier this month alleged thatanimal fat was used in the preparation of Tirupati laddusduring the tenure of the previous YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government, sparking a major political controversy. On September 19, a report by NDDB CALF, a private laboratory focused on testing animal feed and milk and milk products, revealed that the samples of the ghee used in making Tirupati laddus contained foreign fat, including palm oil, fish oil, beef tallow and lard (obtained by rendering the fatty tissue of a pig)."

Speaking exclusively to India Todayafter being released from detention, Wangchuk also urged the central government to keep its promise of bringing Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. ""The government should not do things that will make them not respected. I want to correct them and only the best of friends do that. I want to tell them to keep their promises and come out as trustworthy leaders. Around 120 people from Ladakh, including Wangchuk,were detained by police at the Delhi borderon Monday night while they were marching towards the capital to demand the inclusion of Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The Sixth Schedule addresses the governance of tribal areas in specific northeastern states, including Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, by establishing ""autonomous districts and autonomous regions"" to safeguard the rights of indigenous communities. The marchersaim to secure similar protection for Ladakh. When asked about the demands for a separate statehood for Ladakh, Wangchuk emphasised that it is only the wish of the people of the Union Territory and not a demand. ""Statehood is not a promise. Many people say that statehood for Ladakh was promised by the Centre, but that's not true. It is only an appeal and demand from the people of Ladakh that they should enjoy the same fruits of democracy as the rest of India. However, the Sixth Schedule was a clear promise. You can check the manifestos of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the 2020 Ladakh council. It was on the top agenda of the manifesto that Ladakh would be included in the Sixth Schedule,"" Wangchuk explained. #EXCLUSIVE..""Statehood is not a promise...it is only an appeal from the people of Ladakh...now 6th schedule is a clear promise.."" -Sonam Wangchuk, Climate Activist#NewsToday#SonamWangchuk#Ladakh(@sardesairajdeep)@Wangchuk66pic.twitter.com/20uoMpcSz4— IndiaToday (@IndiaToday)October 3, 2024 The activist also questioned the reason behind delaying the demand for the last five years. ""I am not against a party or for a party. I would just like to remind the government of its promises,"" he said. ""I was assured by the Home Ministry that this will happen, and I am still trusting the government,"" he added. Wangchuk was leading the march,'Delhi Chalo Padyatra', which began from Leh a month ago. His detention was criticised by several opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, whocalled it ""very bad"" and ""unacceptable"". ""The detention of Sonam Wangchuk ji and hundreds of Ladakhis peacefully marching for environmental and constitutional rights is unacceptable. Why are the elderly being detained at Delhi’s border for standing up for Ladakh’s future? Modi ji, like with the farmers, this ‘Chakravyuh’ will be broken, and so will your arrogance. You will have to listen to Ladakh’s voice,"" Rahul Gandhi had posted on X."

Addressing a public rally in Tirupati, Kalyan advocated for non-cooperation with individuals or organisations that attempt to defame or incite hatred against 'Sanatana Dharma'. His remarks came amid the ongoing controversy over the quality of laddus distributed at the Tirupati temple. ""Sanatana Dharma certification must be implemented to ensure the purity of materials used in offerings and prasadams at all the temples of India,"" Kalyan said. This certificate, he suggested, would maintain the sanctity of temple practices and safeguard religious traditions. He also called for the formation of a 'Sanatana Dharma Protection Board' at both the national and state levels to safeguard the principles of Sanatana Dharma and ensure its preservation across the country. He stressed the need for dedicated annual funds to support the board and its activities. ""A strong national Act is required to protect Sanatana Dharma and prevent actions that harm its beliefs. This Act should be enacted immediately and uniformly enforced across the Bharat. A 'Sanatana Dharma Protection Board' should be established at both the national and state level to oversee the implementation of this Act. Annual funds must be allocated to support this board and its activities,"" he said. These boards, according to the Jana Sena Party chief, would be responsible for ensuring that the ideals of 'Sanatana Dharma' are upheld and protected. ""There should be non-cooperation with those who spread hatred against Sanatana Dharma,"" he said. In his 'Varahi' declaration, Pawan Kalyan called upon Sanatanis (Hindus) to unite and transcend regional, linguistic, and other divides in order to stand against the attacks on Sanatana Dharma. He also emphasised the importance of raising their collective voice in defence of their traditions while maintaining respect for other faiths. Further in his speech, Pawan Kalyan also slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for calling the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony a'Naach Gaana Sabha'(Dancing and singing programme). ""Rahul Gandhi says the Ayodhya ceremony was a'Naach Gaana Sabha'. You hurt Sanatani Hindus and then seek their votes for power? You might hate Modi ji, hate us, but don't dare to hate Lord Ram,"" Kalyan said."

The government welcomes the agreement between UK and Mauritus on the long-standing legal dispute.,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202410/chagos-03125726-1x1.jpeg?VersionId=Ud7.jLRLKHHWOMCr7D.s4OX_.figE.UN&size=115:115,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-welcomes-chagos-islands-agreement-uk-mauritius-2610844-2024-10-03,"The government on Thursday said that the agreement on thereturn of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago""completes the decolonisation of Mauritius"". The government expressed its strong support for the agreement between the United Kingdom and Mauritius. “The resolution of the long-standing Chagos dispute after two years of negotiations, in compliance with international law, is a welcome development,” the Ministry of External Affairs said, adding that India has consistently supported Mauritius’ claim of sovereignty over the islands. The government reiterated its firm stance on decolonisation and respect for territorial integrity, emphasising its longstanding partnership with Mauritius. The UK and Mauritius recently announced a ""historic"" agreement that will transfer sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while maintaining the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, which will remain operational for at least 99 more years. This settlement, which has been under negotiation since 2022, resolves a decades-long territorial dispute and secures the future of the strategically important military base. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a diplomatic success that ensures continued stability in the Indian Ocean region. “The Prime Minister reiterated the importance of protecting the UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, underscoring national and global security,” a Downing Street statement read. Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth also celebrated the agreement as a momentous occasion, stating, “Today marks the completion of our decolonisation, a long-awaited moment for the people of Mauritius.” US President Joe Biden applauded the agreement, highlighting its importance in securing Diego Garcia's role in global security for the next century. The military base has been crucial in maintaining regional stability and responding to crises in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. While the agreement has been welcomed by many, including the international community, some groups representing displaced Chagos Islanders have expressed frustration over being excluded from the negotiations. The Chagossian diaspora in the UK and Mauritius have long sought resettlement rights following their forced displacement in the 1970s to make way for the military base. India has backed Mauritus in the legal dispute over the Island. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankarreaffirmed New Delhi’s supportfor Mauritius during a visit to Port Louis earlier this year. India’s backing aligned with its broader principles on sovereignty and its special relationship with Mauritius, a fellow member of the Commonwealth. In the agreement between Mauritius and the UK, India played a quiet but important role in the background, as per a report by news agencyANI. “It firmly backed the principled Mauritian position, supporting its stance on the need to do away with the last vestiges of decolonisation. At the same time, it consistently encouraged both sides to negotiate with an open mind and with a view to achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. It is believed that the final outcome is a win for all sides involved and will reinforce long-term security in the Indian Ocean region,” the report added. The new agreement paves the way for Mauritius to manage resettlement on all islands except Diego Garcia. The treaty is expected to be finalised soon, marking a resolution to one of the last colonial-era territorial disputes."

The bench was hearing petitions seeking the release of Wangchuk and his associates as well as challenging the prohibitory order. As many as 120 people from Ladakh, including Wangchuk, were allegedly detained at the Delhi border by police earlier this week while marching to the capital to demand the inclusion of Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Wangchuk was leading the march,'Delhi Chalo Padyatra', which began from Leh a month ago.

They gave a memorandum which was accepted by the Ministry of Home Affairs. They have also left,"" he added.

""If Prashant Bhushan has other information, he should file an affidavit and disclose the source of his information,"" the Solicitor General responded, challenging Bhushan's claim. The court, acknowledging Mehta's statement, recorded the information and proceeded to dispose of the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the matter."

Months later, Bind now finds himself working in the heart of war-torn West Asia, earning a salary he could only dream of in India. DespiteIsrael's ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gazaand Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, Bind remains resolute in his decision to stay in the country. Tensions recently spiked when Iran launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel late on Tuesday night. In response, theIndian Embassy in Israel issued an advisoryurging its citizens to avoid unnecessary travel and seek safety in shelters whenever possible. Despite the uncertainty on the ground, Bind has no plans to return to India. ""No one is forcing me to work here. I am here because I want to be,"" Bind stated. ""I'm earning well, and I'm also sending money back home to my family"". Atul Singh, another worker recruited through the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), echoes similar sentiments. ""The issues are mainly with those recruited through private companies or middlemen. We, who were recruited directly through the government, face no such problems,"" he explained. The lure of high wages continues to draw many Indian workers, even amidst the chaos. Bahadur, a 36-year-old from Haryana, highlighted the economic opportunities: ""Where else will I earn this kind of money, save, and still be able to send it back home with dignity?"" India has become apreferred hub for Israel to source its skilled labour force, particularly after the suspension of work permits for thousands of Palestinians following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. As Palestinian workers, previously the backbone of Israel's construction sector, have been sidelined, Indian labourers have increasingly taken their place. The Israeli government, facing a significant workforce gap, has been actively recruiting from India to support their infrastructure and healthcare sectors. Indian youth have seized this opportunity, with thousands lining up outside recruitment centres in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, eager to secure employment in Israel. In a recent initiative, Israel's Population, Immigration, and Border Authority (PIBA) requested the NSDC to recruit 10,000 construction workers and 5,000 caregivers. Between December 2023 and March 2024, 16,832 candidates underwent skill tests, with 10,349 selected for jobs in Israel. So far, about 5,800 have migrated, with 4,800 already working there and 1,000 more sent in September this year. Selected candidates are earning approximately Rs 1.92 lakh per month, along with a bonus of Rs 16,515, medical insurance, and accommodation. This government-backed recruitment has ensured that workers avoid the pitfalls of dealing with middlemen, often a source of exploitation. A source from India's Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship confirmed the numbers, stating, ""We have sent 5,800 skilled labourers to Israel, and the total number selected is close to 11,000. The documentation process for the remaining candidates is ongoing"". Israel had initially aimed to recruit between 50,000 to 100,000 Indian workers, but recent Iranian airstrikes and a significant escalation of conflict in West Asia may disrupt these plans. However, for many skilled labourers in India — where the unemployment rate stands at 6.6 per cent — this presents a rare opportunity to earn wages far beyond what they could achieve at home."

The SIT, led by state crime branch chief H. Venkatesh, will investigate the alleged failures of police officers related to the disruption of the annual temple festival. ADGP (Law and Order) MR Ajith Kumar is accused of conspiring with the RSS for undisclosed reasons. On April 19, the day of Thrissur Pooram, police used excessive force to control the crowd and imposed strict restrictions, including limiting entry and setting up barricades. The fireworks display, a key attraction, was held during the day for the first time in history as a protest against the ""unusual police restrictions."" Following these incidents, action was taken against the Thrissur city police commissioner and assistant commissioner. The previous investigation, led by Ajith Kumar, was submitted to the Chief Minister on September 24, but the Opposition dismissed it as a farce, accusing Kumar of blaming the temple board for the disruption and ignoring police failings. The probe team will now look into various accusations surrounding the event. Senior Intelligence officer Manoj Abraham will investigate any lapses by officers across departments tasked with festival duties. This new investigation follows claims that the previous report, submitted by Ajith Kumar, was inadequate. The Chief Minister stated that the Director General of Police had already noted lapses on Ajith Kumar's part. The cabinet has directed the state police chief to investigate further and submit a detailed report. The enquiry comes amid allegations by the Opposition and former Left-backed Independent MLA PV Anvar that the disruption was aimed at benefiting the BJP in the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat, which BJP’s Suresh Gopi won by a significant margin."

In a complaint filed on October 1, Vijay Tata claimed that JD(S) leader Ramesh Gowda visited his house on August 24, dialled Kumaraswamy's number, and made him talk to the Union minister, who demanded money from him. Kumaraswamy allegedly demanded Rs 50 crore from Tata for the Channapatna bypoll, threatening him that if the money was not arranged, it would be difficult for him to run his real estate business or even survive in Bengaluru. In his complaint, Tata further alleged that Ramesh Gowda told him that a ticket had been confirmed for Nikhil Kumaraswamy (HD Kumaraswamy's son) to contest the bypolls from Channapatna, and Rs 50 crore was required for that. Nikhil Kumaraswamy was fielded by the JD(S) from Channapatna Assembly constituency for bypolls as his father HD Kumaraswamy vacated the seat after he was elected to Lok Sabha in June. ""During a casual conversation, he handed over the phone to Kumaraswamy. In the previous elections, we had covered all the expenses for his campaign. This time, Kumaraswamy told us it was a matter of prestige and requested that we arrange Rs 50 crore for him"", Tata claimed. ""I explained that it was impossible for us to arrange that amount, as all our projects were pending. He became furious when I said that. He demanded Rs 50 crore at any cost and warned me, saying he wouldn’t allow me to survive in Bengaluru. He told me it would be very difficult to complete my projects and then disconnected the call,"" he added. Acting on the complaint, the Amruthahalli police filed a case against Kumaraswamy and Ramesh Gowda under sections 3(5),308(2),351(2)) of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), 2023. HD Kumaraswamy was elected as an MP from Karnataka's Mandya after the Lok Sabha election results were announced on June 4 and was appointed as the Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel. Meanwhile, in a separate case, an FIR was registered against Karnataka BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal for his statement alleging that a ""great leader had set aside Rs 1,000 crore"" to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka, in a veiled dig at Siddaramaiah. The FIR was registered after a complaint filed by the Congress at the High Grounds police station."

Some international flights passing over Iran were mid-flight when Iran began launching ballistic missiles at Israel on the night of 1 October, in retaliation for crippling Tehran-supported militias in the region. According to flight tracking site Flightradar24, two flights of the German carrier Lufthansa – operating between Frankfurt and Mumbai & Hyderabad, LH756 and LH752 respectively – turned back from Turkish airspace before entering Iran during the missile attack. Polish airline LOT’s Warsaw-Mumbai flight and Air India’s London-Mumbai flight were also in Iranian airspace at the time of the attack. While LOT’s flight LO75 was diverted to Baku airport in Azerbaijan, Air India’s flight AIC128 continued its journey to Mumbai. On 2 October, Lufthansa cancelled its flights from Hyderabad to Frankfurt (LH753/01) and from Mumbai to Frankfurt (LH757/01) due to tensions in West Asia, according to flight tracking data. “Passengers have been rerouted or accommodated,” Jeffrey James, Head of Lufthansa Group Communications - Asia Pacific, told news agency PTI. Lufthansa operates around 65 weekly flights from Europe to India. As tensions continue, airlines – particularly those operating between India and Europe – have redrawn their flight paths to avoid Iran and other countries where Iran-backed militia groups are active. The situation is similar for flights making stopovers in Gulf and Arab countries. For instance, Qatar Airways’ Delhi-London & Delhi-Milan flights, and Etihad’s Mumbai-London flight EY17 now fly over Saudi Arabia and Egypt instead of Iraq. On 2 October, some flights to and from India were delayed. In a statement, Air India said that all its flights are assessed daily for potential security or safety risks, whether in the Middle East or any other part of its route network. ""Adjustments are made, if required, to avoid areas of risk with minimal impact on our non-stop operations. The situation is being closely monitored,"" the airline said. Air India has already suspended flights to Tel Aviv (Israel) until further notice. Other global airlines have also diverted or cancelled flights post-attack, with regional airports, including in Lebanon, Israel, and Kuwait, showing significant delays. Emirates has announced it is cancelling all regular flights to/from Iraq (Basra and Baghdad), Iran (Tehran), and Jordan (Amman) on 4 and 5 October. “We continue to closely monitor the situation in the region and are in contact with the relevant authorities regarding developments,” it said in a statement on Thursday. ""Most airlines have rerouted flights away from Iran, with the northern route taking flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India on their way to Asia, and the southern route flying over Egypt and Saudi Arabia,"" said FlightRadar24 spokesperson Ian Petchenik, according to Reuters. Concerns over travel disruption as the conflict intensifies have also affected shares in the travel and airline sectors. Iran launched its largest missile attack against Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for Israel's campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, prompting a threat from Israel of a ""painful response."" Among Indian carriers, Vistara’s VTI023 Mumbai-Paris, Mumbai-Frankfurt flight UK27, New Delhi-Frankfurt VTI025, as well as Air India’s London-Mumbai flight AIC128, have started taking a circuitous route through Tajikistan and Turkmenistan from 2 October, as per Flightradar24 data."

Speaking at a press conference in Thiruvananthapuram, Vijayan stressed the importance of adhering to these instructions as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated. ""Imperialism is once again setting the stage for another war in the Middle East,"" he said, voicing strong criticism against Israel’s actions in the region. He stated that Israel's aggressive stance, despite global public opinion and a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for its withdrawal, was pushing the Middle East towards a full-scale war. The Chief Minister accused Israel of ignoring international calls for peace and singled out the United States and NATO for continuing to support Israel’s ""atrocities in Palestine."" ""We are at a time when we don’t know if the world is going into a war,"" said Vijayan, expressing concern about the worsening situation. At the press conference, the Kerala Chief Minister also criticised the central government for its inadequate response to the Wayanad landslides, which claimed several lives and caused massive damage. Vijayan stated that Kerala had requested an emergency relief fund of Rs 291 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), but so far, only Rs 145.6 crore had been sanctioned, and this was not specific to the disaster. Vijayan urged the Centre to release the necessary funds promptly, stating that Kerala is still reeling from the devastation caused by the landslides."

The incident was reported in Koppal District Maternity and Children's Hospital. The woman, identified as Gauri, claimed she was wrongly informed about the gender of her newborn, leading to a devastating mix-up. Gauri was admitted to the hospital on September 23, and gave birth in the early hours of September 25. Due to the baby’s low weight, the newborn was immediately transferred to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for monitoring. Gauri says the medical staff initially informed her she had given birth to a girl. However, on October 2, hospital staff broke the devastating news that the baby had died. When Gauri and her family arrived to see the child, they were shocked to discover that the deceased infant was a boy, not the girl they were expecting. ""We were told we had a girl, but now they've handed us a dead boy. We want our baby back,"" Gauri said, grief-stricken. Hospital authorities, acknowledging the possibility of a mistake, stated the mix-up could have occurred during the transfer of the newborn between departments. They have assured the family that a full investigation will be conducted."

A political controversy erupted after Rao, while addressing an event in Bengaluru to mark Gandhi Jayanti, claimed that Savarkar was not only a meat-eater, who consumed beef, but also propagated the practice publicly. ""Once again, sorry for speaking the truth!"" Rao said in a post on X after his remarks triggered a political stir and BJP took strong objection to it. ""Savarkar, a 'Chitpavan Brahmin', used to eat meat. He was a non-veg eater and he was not against cow slaughter. He was modern in a way. Some say that he used to eat beef as well. As a Brahmin, he used to eat meat and was openly propagating eating meat. So he had that thinking,"" the minister claimed earlier in the day. His remarks drew sharp criticism from the BJP, which questioned why the Congress was always targeting Hindus. ""Congress' God is Tipu Sultan. Why are you Congress people always targeting Hindus? Why not Muslims? The Congress mindset is like this. Hindus have given a verdict in the elections. Every Hindu will teach them a lesson,"" BJP leader R Ashok said. Even Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis attacked the grand old party and said that Rahul Gandhi began defaming Savarkar and now others are just taking his narrative forward. ""These people do not know anything about Savarkar. They insult Savarkar ji again and again. Savarkar ji has expressed his views on cows very well.

In its response filed before the Supreme Court, the Centre said that in marriage ""there exists a continuing expectations, by either of the spouse, to have reasonable sexual access from the other"". The Centre, however, clarified that the expectations do not entitle the husband to coerce or force his wife into sex against her will. In the response, the Centre argued that the issue of marital rape is more of a social concern than a legal one and requires extensive consultations with various stakeholders before any decision can be made. It contended that marriage in India is regarded as an institution of reciprocal obligations, where vows are considered inviolable. It stated that while the consent of women within marriage is statutorily protected, the penal provisions governing this are different. ""...the sexual aspect is but one of the many facets of the relationships between husband and wife, on which the bedrock of their marriage rests,"" it said. The Centre argued that sufficient legal remedies already exist under current statutes for victims of marital abuse, and striking down the exception could destabilise the institution of marriage. The Supreme Court is currently hearing an appeal against thesplit verdict of the Delhi High Courton the validity of Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which exempts husbands from being charged with rape within marriage. The Delhi High Court had delivereda divided ruling,with Justice Rajiv Shakdher declaring the provision unconstitutional, while Justice C Hari Shankar upheld it. In addition, the Supreme Court had stayed a judgement from the Karnataka High Court that refused to quash rape charges against a man accused of sexually assaulting his wife and holding her as a sex slave. Petitioners, including activist Ruth Manorama, have argued that the marital rape exception violates women’s consent, bodily autonomy, and dignity, calling for its removal. The Centre, however, insists that any decision on criminalising marital rape must be made by the legislature, not the judiciary, given its far-reaching social consequences."
